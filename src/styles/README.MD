# Styles Files
All global files of the application shall be stored in this folder.
Separate files must be created for each functionality. 
If they are styles referring to global components, they must go in the `components` folder.
If they are styles referring to variables, they must go in the `variables` folder.
It is important to import the files created in the files named as the folder, and check that at the end everything is imported in the `_styles.scss` file.
